## 📖 Project Overview
This project builds a production-minded assistive vision system for navigation workflow inside the broader area of environmental and social impact AI. It follows the same pattern as a strong portfolio implementation: define the prediction or decision task, prepare a small baseline dataset, train a reliable model, evaluate it with appropriate metrics, and outline the path to a deployable application.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives (What You Will Build)
1. Translate assistive vision system for navigation from an idea into a measurable ML task.
2. Build a reproducible Python baseline with clean preprocessing and evaluation.
3. Identify the production risks that appear once the prototype meets real data.

---

## 🏗️ Implementation Blueprint
### Data
Collect representative images or video frames for assistive vision system for navigation, then label a small validation set.

### Model
Train a baseline classifier, detector, or segmenter before moving to larger pretrained models.

### Evaluation
Measure both model quality and operational behavior such as latency and false negatives.

### Deployment
Export an inference pipeline with preprocessing, confidence thresholds, and monitoring.

## 🚀 Quickstart Guide

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Optional: Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

## 📈 Production Hardening & Next Steps
- Replace the starter data with a real dataset such as satellite data.
- Add experiment tracking so model versions, parameters, and metrics are auditable.
- Create a small API or dashboard that exposes predictions to real users.
- Add monitoring for drift, missing inputs, latency, and degraded model quality.

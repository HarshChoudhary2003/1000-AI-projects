## 📖 Project Overview
This project builds a production-minded prompt transparency documentation system workflow inside the broader area of explainability and trustworthy AI. It follows the same pattern as a strong portfolio implementation: define the prediction or decision task, prepare a small baseline dataset, train a reliable model, evaluate it with appropriate metrics, and outline the path to a deployable application.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives (What You Will Build)
1. Translate prompt transparency documentation system from an idea into a measurable ML task.
2. Build a reproducible Python baseline with clean preprocessing and evaluation.
3. Identify the production risks that appear once the prototype meets real data.

## 🏗️ Implementation Blueprint
### Corpus
Assemble text examples for prompt transparency documentation system, including realistic noisy inputs and edge cases.

### Features
Use TF-IDF or transformer embeddings as a baseline representation layer.

### Evaluation
Inspect precision, recall, and qualitative errors on real user-facing examples.

### Deployment
Package the pipeline behind an API with prompt, text, and data privacy safeguards.

## 📈 Production Hardening & Next Steps
- Replace the starter data with a real dataset such as tabular model data.
- Add experiment tracking so model versions, parameters, and metrics are auditable.
- Create a small API or dashboard that exposes predictions to real users.
- Add monitoring for drift, missing inputs, latency, and degraded model quality.

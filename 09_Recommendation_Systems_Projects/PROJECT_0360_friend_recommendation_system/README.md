# Project 360: Friend recommendation system

**Category:** Recommendation Systems Projects  
**Difficulty:** Applied  
**Domain:** personalization and ranking  
**Tags:** `Applied`, `friend`, `recommendation`, `systems`, `projects`

## 📖 Project Overview
This project builds a production-minded friend recommendation system workflow inside the broader area of personalization and ranking. It follows the same pattern as a strong portfolio implementation: define the prediction or decision task, prepare a small baseline dataset, train a reliable model, evaluate it with appropriate metrics, and outline the path to a deployable application.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives (What You Will Build)
1. Translate friend recommendation system from an idea into a measurable ML task.
2. Build a reproducible Python baseline with clean preprocessing and evaluation.
3. Identify the production risks that appear once the prototype meets real data.

## 🏗️ Implementation Blueprint
### Signals
Combine behavior, item metadata, and context for friend recommendation system.

### Ranking
Start with similarity or matrix factorization, then layer business rules for safety and diversity.

### Evaluation
Measure offline ranking metrics and compare them with online engagement signals.

### Deployment
Serve recommendations with caching, fallback logic, and feedback capture.

## 🚀 Quickstart Guide

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Optional: Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Implementation
```bash
python main.py
```

## 📈 Production Hardening & Next Steps
- Replace the starter data with a real dataset such as MovieLens.
- Add experiment tracking so model versions, parameters, and metrics are auditable.
- Create a small API or dashboard that exposes predictions to real users.
- Add monitoring for drift, missing inputs, latency, and degraded model quality.
